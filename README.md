# 🧩 42 CPP Exercises - My Journey Through C++ Basics

Welcome to my collection of C++ exercises for the 42 curriculum! This repository contains various projects and exercises aimed at mastering the basics and advanced concepts of C++.

---

## **📜 Project Overview**
The goal of these exercises is to build a solid foundation in C++ by working through a series of progressively challenging tasks. Each project focuses on different aspects of the language, from basic syntax to advanced features like object-oriented programming, memory management, and more.

### **Key Concepts:**
Each exercise targets specific concepts in C++:
- **Basic Syntax and Control Structures:** Understanding the basic syntax, loops, and conditionals in C++.
- **Functions:** Writing and using functions to encapsulate logic.
- **Classes and Objects:** Introduction to object-oriented programming.
- **Inheritance and Polymorphism:** Leveraging OOP principles to create more complex programs.
- **Memory Management:** Understanding pointers, references, and dynamic memory allocation.
- **STL:** Utilizing the Standard Template Library for efficient programming.

### **Features**
Each project includes:
- **Detailed Exercise Instructions:** Clear instructions and requirements for each task.
- **Example Output:** Sample outputs to help you understand the expected results.
- **Test Cases:** Sample test cases to validate your solutions.

### **Requirements**
- No memory leaks allowed.
- Each project must include:
  - **Makefile** with rules:
    - `all` (compile project)
    - `clean` (remove object files)
    - `fclean` (remove object files & executable)
    - `re` (recompile everything)
  - Detailed comments and documentation for code clarity.
